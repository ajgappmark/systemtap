This is a collection of tests for systemtap.


Running the Testsuite
*********************

There are two ways to run the testsuite and pass additional parameters to
DejaGnu.  The first is to do `make check' in the main build directory and
specifying the makefile variable `RUNTESTFLAGS':

        make check RUNTESTFLAGS='argv.exp -v --debug'

"make check" runs unprivileged tests only against an uninstalled build tree.
"make installcheck" runs all tests against an installed tree. E.g.

        make installcheck RUNTESTFLAGS=

Runs whole the testsuite.


Parallel testing
****************

To save testing time, you can run the systemtap test suite in a fully parallel
mode using the installcheck-parallel target.  In this mode, each .exp file runs
separately and maybe simultaneously.  The test suite ensures that all the
temporary files created by the test suite do not clash, by putting them into
separate subdirectories of testsuite/artifacts. E.g.

        make -j6 installcheck-parallel

runs all tests against an installed tree in parallel mode. You can use the -j
parameter of make to specify the number of tests to run simultaneously.

Some tests need to be run serially, like e.g. the server tests.  They start a
new systemtap server and only expect one local server to run.  Their logs are
being kept in separate artifacts/__serialtests folder.

There are a few tests known to be slow. We run them right from the beginning to
try to lessen the overall time taken by the test suite -- if one of these tests
happens to be run late, it will cause the overall time to increase.

After the parallel test run is finished, systemtap.sum and systemtap.log files
get generated as usual, but, please, see dg-extract-results.sh script for
limitations.

Setting -j6 seems to be testtime-wise optimum for Lenovo T440s.  In this case
the load is around 8.  You can limit the load using -l.  See man make.  In this
particular case the testing time is around 60 mins, which is about 1/4 of the
time needed for the full serial run.

In parallel mode, you can use the TESTS variable pass on the command line to
easily say "Only run these tests.". The RUNTESTFLAGS variable is still available
for passing additional parameters to DejaGnu. So, e.g.  

        make -j2 installcheck-parallel RUNTESTFLAGS= TESTS='*/argv.exp */add.exp'

runs argv.exp and add.exp in parallel.
